        "\n",
        "  Ans-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. It organizes code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. The key idea is to group related data and behavior together into objects'''\n",
        "\n",
        "'''2.What is a class in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        " A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. Think of it like a recipe: the class describes how to make something, but it’s not the actual thing itself—that's the object.'''\n",
        "\n",
        "'''3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It is the actual thing created using the blueprint defined by the class. Each object has its own data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined in the class'''\n",

        "'''4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "1. Abstraction - Hiding the complexity, showing only what’s necessary\n",
        "What it does:\n",
        "Shows only the relevant details to the user and hides the complex implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal:\n",
        "To reduce complexity and make the system easier to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-life example:\n",
        "When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift—you don't need to know how the engine or braking system works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and requiring interaction through methods\n",
        "What it does:\n",
        "Binds data and methods into a single unit (a class), and hides the internal state from the outside world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal:\n",
        "To protect data from unauthorized access and modification.\n",

        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods, also known as magic methods) are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc'''\n",
        "\n",
        "'''6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This enables code reuse and helps create a clear, hierarchical structure.'''\n",
        "\n",
        "'''7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same type, usually through a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "It enables the same method name to behave differently based on the object calling it.'''\n",
        "\n",
        "'''8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that work on that data into a single unit—a class—and restricting access to some of the object’s internal details.'''\n",
        "\n",
        "'''9. What is a constructor in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method in a class that gets called automatically when a new object is created. It’s used to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",

        "'''10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods (@classmethod)\n",
        "A class method is a method that gets the class itself as the first argument instead of the instance. It's marked with the @classmethod decorator\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods (@staticmethod)\n",
        "A static method doesn't receive self or cls. It behaves like a regular function but lives inside the class for organizational purposes\n",

        "'''11.What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Python doesn’t support true method overloading out of the box.\n",

        "\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows the child class to customize or replace behavior inherited from the parent class.'''\n",

        "\n",
        "The @property decorator is used to turn a method into a “read-only” property. It lets you access a method like an attribute, without using parentheses'''\n",

        "\n",
